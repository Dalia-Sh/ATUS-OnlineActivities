# ATUS-OnlineActivities

## Overview

Since the emergence of the internet, individual's activities have changed, and more online activities have started to take place. Some activities, like reading the newspaper or watching movies, are now being done through the internet. Other activities, like surfing the web for personel interest or checking Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, are new activities that have emerged as a result of the introduction of internet in our day to day life. 

The internet's value cannot be measured monetarily, and hence, measuring its contribution to economic growth is challenging. Wallsten's research discusses a novel approach to measuring the value of online activities, by evaluating the opportunity cost of online leisure activity. 

Wallsten evaluates the opportunity cost of online leisure activity by measuring the time forgone on other activities. This is called the 'crowd-out effect'.

Using the ATUS (American Time Use Survey) dataset for years 2003-2011, he estimated 18 versions of equations (one for each major activity) and uses the coefficient (and t-statistics) on the computer variable from each regression as a measurement of the crowd-out effect of computer leisure on each major category.
